## Welcome to Nidal TEST Blog

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NidalFikri/test.github.io/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```xml
rule hancitor : loader
{
	meta:
		description = "This is a noob rule."
		author = "Nidal Fikri @cyber_anubis"
		
	strings:
	$mz = {4D 5A}			//PE File

	condition:
	($mz at 0) 
}
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NidalFikri/test.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
